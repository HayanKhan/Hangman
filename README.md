This game was made with the help of stanfords starting files and knowledge in understanding string manipulation and logical arithmetic. This game also displays knowledge in Java by applying multiple concepts into a single program.

Hangman is an old childhood game that was remade by me. This game shows the combination of text based user input with graphical output.
